Recently I went to Cedar Point with my cousins and my aunt. 
And after that I stayed with them in an Airbnb, sadly I got a blister from walking too far. 
I had to stay at the house for most of the other events my aunt had planned for us.

Soon, also, I'm gonna go to a halloween fair with my grandma and my mom.
The same fairground was used when I went to a concert with my grandma and mom.
It is not confirmed whether I can or cannot go to Puerto Rico yet for christmas break.
