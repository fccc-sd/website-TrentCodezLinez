    <main><h2>Family/Friends.</h2>
    
    <p> My family is a complicated story,<br> 
        when i was just a baby my dad left me and my mom. 
        Then my grandma took care of me for about 5 years. 
        Afterwards I lived with my mom for a few years. 
        Now I live with my grandma, and im also much happier. 
        And my grades also improved because of that.</p>

<h2>General Info About Myself.</h2>

        <p>My full name is</p> <div>Trent Alaric Aparicio</div>, <p>but most people just call me <strong>Trent</strong> or <strong>Big T</strong>, depending on who you are.
             I have multiple hobbies but out of them my favorite is definitely building legos. 
             I have several disablities but they don't hold me back from the things I want to accomplish. 
             I have two favorite colors, blue and green, I am six foot and two inches tall, and I am sixteen years old.</p>

    <h2>School and other stuff.</h2>
        <p><a href="https://mrgeiger.com">Mr Geigers website</a></p>

        <p>My home school is <span>Liberty Center</span> and I was there ever since fourth grade.
             My original school though is Delta, I quit because as "therapy" they locked me in a room. 
             At Liberty I actually met my first <strong>REAL</strong> friend, Louis Colins. 
             Ever since we first met we've been best buds, me and him are like glue. 
             A while after i got into freshman year I got myself another <strong>REAL</strong> friend, his name is Logun Howard.</p> 

<h2>Favorites</h2>
<p>My favorite video game of all time is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a>, Minecraft is an open world sandbox type game.
    My favorite food I would say would be Cheeseburgers. 
    My favorite movie would probablly be Wall-E. 
    And last but cetrtainly not least, my favorite colors are blue and green.</p>

<h2>The deal with <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us">LEGO&copy;</a></h2>
<p>My obsession with legos all began when I was four, back then I played with duplos.
     As I grew older I developed a more <em>fond</em> expression towards legos. 
     As of now it's a regular thing for me to build legos, and I usually build them once every week. 
     From then I started getting better and building more complex lego structures.</p>
