    <p> My family is a complicated story,<br> when i was just a baby my dad left me and my mom. Then my grandma took care of me for about 5 years. Afterwards I lived with my mom for a few years. Now I live with my grandma, and im also much happier. And my grades also improved because of that.</p>

<h2>General Info About Myself.</h2>

        <p>My full name is Trent Alaric Aparicio, but most people just call me <strong>Trent</strong> or <strong>Big T</strong>, depending on who you are. I have multiple hobbies but out of them my favorite is definitely building legos. I have several disablities but they don't hold me back from the things I want to accomplish. I have two favorite colors, blue and green, I am six foot and two inches tall, and I am sixteen years old.</p>

    <h2>School and other stuff.</h2>

        <p>My home school is Liberty Center and I was there ever since fourth grade. My original school though is Delta, I quit because as "therapy" they locked me in a room. At Liberty I actually met my first <strong>REAL</strong> friend, Louis Colins. Ever since we first met we've been best buds, me and him are like glue. A while after i got into freshman year I got myself another <strong>REAL</strong> friend, his name is Logun Howard.</p> 

<h2>Favorites</h2>
<p>My favorite video game of all time is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a>, Minecraft is an open world sandbox type game. My favorite food I would say would be Cheeseburgers. My favorite movie woul probaly be Wall-E. And last but cetrtainly not least, my favorite colors are blue and green.</p>

<h2>The deal with <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us">LEGO&copy;</a></h2>
<p>My obsession with legos all began when I was like four, back then I played with duplos. As I grew older I developed a more <em>fond</em> expression towards legos. As of now it's a regular thing for me to build legos, and I usually build them once every week. From then I started getting better and building more complex lego structures.</p>
