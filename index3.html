<h2>
my main passtime or hobby I would say is building LEGOs.
</h2>
<p>
My obsession with legos all began when I was four, back then I played with duplos.
     As I grew older I developed a more <em>fond</em> expression towards legos. 
     As of now it's a regular thing for me to build legos, and I usually build them once every week. 
     From then I started getting better and building more complex lego structures.
